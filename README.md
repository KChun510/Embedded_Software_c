# UCI Embedded Systems – AVR Microcontroller Programming

Welcome to the repository for the UCI Embedded Software class.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this course is to gain hands-on experience in:

- Programming AVR microcontrollers (MCUs) in C
- Interfacing with a wide range of hardware components
- Reading and applying datasheet specifications to real hardware systems
- Understanding low-level control of digital I/O, timers, communication protocols, and more
